			<h1>Personal Website <i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
			<p>Languages used: <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong></p>
			<p> This project has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable projects to work on. 
				It has been a long and iterative process, but I am glad that I was able to achieve what I aimed for. 
				After completing my online course based on the basics of web coding, I was quite eager to build a website on my own. 
				Several websites and YouTube videos helped me to expand my knowledge further.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Planning</h2>
			<p>
				The first step was planning and designing the appearance of the website. 
				It was as simple as grabbing a piece of paper and pen and using my creativity to design the page. 
				The initial design wasn't the final one. 
				It was an iterative process and involved a series of designing, coding and re-designing. 
				The design that initially appeared to be the best did not look good after I coded it. 
				Therefore, I was open minded when making any kind of changes. 
				It was essential to maintain a similar pattern throughout the website. 
				I planned each section of the pages well, by considering the placements of each component and the content as well. 
				I also created my personal logo, using <a href="https://logomakr.com/">LogoMakr</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Action</h2>
			<p> After the designing the layout of the webpage, it was finally time to write the code and test the design.
				Coding was the most satisfying and exciting part of the entire process as I could immediately see the result of a piece of code that I wrote and therefore I could actually see my design being implemented and was able to observe how the tiny changes made huge impacts in the design. 
				I used Notepad++ to write the code. 
				I analysed my design from top to bottom and planned the properties and rules that might be required to be applied to the different HTML elements. 
				Next, I structured the webpage using HTML. 
				After I was satisfied with the structure, I altered the appearance of the webpage using CSS.
				I added the JavaScript code towards the end.
				It was trial and error, many things didn't workout the first time, but that was the way I learnt. 
				I used several websites and YouTube videos to learn and resolve any issues or errors that I faced.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p> In my personal opinion, I achieved what I had designed and planned. 
				The website clearly reflects my personality and interests.
				It is also convenient for the users to navigate through the website. 
				Use of correct fonts and styling enhances readability.
				A similar pattern has been maintained throughout the website, which makes the design clean and allows the user to focus. 
				Overall, it has been designed carefully keeping several aspects in mind and thereby achieves most of its target goals. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Learnings and Improvements</h2>
			<p> This project helped me to develop my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge and coding skills further. 
				I made several mistakes and resolved them myself, which enabled me to learn. 
				This project also helped me to improve my web-designing and problem-solving skills. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Next time, I would ensure I gather all the information regarding the content of the website beforehand and design the pages in more details, as I believe that would save time and make coding easier. 
				I would further like to learn back-end coding, which would enable me to make the website more efficient.
				I believe there is always space to grow and improve.
