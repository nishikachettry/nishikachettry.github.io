			<h1>Aston Tracking System (ATS) <i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
			
			<p>This group project was one of the most interesting and complicated to achieve since I was not much acquainted with the technology that we used. </p>
			
			<h2>What is ATS?</h2>
			<p> ATS is an RFID security system developed to protect the expensive components in the laboratories from unauthorised access.
				It also has its very own SAS (Security Alarm System) which activates in case someone tries to gain unauthorised access. 
				The system consists of a component reader, a card scanner for authorised people to gain access and a security system.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Planning</h2>
			<p> Initially, we were planning to work on a different idea for this group project but after a couple of weeks we realised it was technically too complicated to achieve in the limited timeframe and would be out of budget. 
				Therefore, we had to think of another idea. At this point, I suggested an idea to create a security system for the expensive components in the laboratories. 
				This idea was improved further by adding the security system and other features. 
				I planned the prototyping stages for the system. We used basecamp, gantt chart and a checklist for project management. 
				I regularly updated these for being able to keep track of the progress.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Action</h2>
			<p> We started by programming the component reader, followed by the card scanner. 
				I was responsible for developing the software and prototyping the system. 
				I wasn’t being able to achieve the desired results in a single go; however, I resolved all the errors and issues.
				It was an excellent learning experience as I had never worked with RFID before. 
				It was slightly complicated but was enjoyable. After having prototyped the systems, during the final assembling period, due to Covid-19 the university had to be shut down. 
				However, I continued to work on the finance along with my team-mates. 
				We also delivered an excellent online presentation. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p> We had successfully prototyped all the sub-systems involved. 
				Unfortunately, due to the lockdown we could not assemble the final product. 
				However, the presentation was highly appreciated by my teachers and we also received excellent grades for the project. 
				The video below provides an overview of our product.

			<h2>Learnings and Improvements</h2>
			<p> This project was an excellent learning experience. 
				I familiarised myself with a new technology and learnt about the different aspects of product development. 
				I did not only participate in the technical aspects but also gained an insight into the finance and marketing of a product. 
				Alongside these technical skills, I was also able to develop my soft skills such as communication, presentation and team-work skills. 
				I was also able to learn more about project management which I believe is an essential skill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Next time, I would work on the finance alongside the technical development as that would reduce the pressure of having to complete it together at the end.
