			<h1>About me <i  class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
			<p> Hello! I am Nishika Chettry, an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science from Aston University, United Kingdom. 
				Creating new products and practically applying any knowledge gained is something which I have always enjoyed and is the major reason why I chose to become an engineer. 
			</p>
			<h2>Interest and Hobbies</h2>
			<p> My interests and hobbies majorly include coding, music, dance, sketching, watching ISS and astronaut videos, and creating DIYs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason behind my interest in coding is the fact that it involves logical reasoning and problem solving.
				At times, I look around at the automated things we are surrounded by and then try to think about the coding logic it could have been based on. 
				I aspire to learn several programming languages. Currently, I have knowledge of Java, and basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which helped me build this website. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Space is also one of the most intriguing topic for me since childhood. 
				I have always been curious about the mysteries that the universe holds beyond our planet. 
				The mystery of the black holes, the thought of finding a twin planet or life somewhere else in the universe, settling down in a different celestial body or being able to connect with a much more advanced civilisation than ourselves, all these thoughts are the reasons behind my interest in space. 
				Videos of astronauts working and performing daily activities on board the ISS are one of the best sources to see how microgravity makes even the most ordinary things fun and interesting.
				These videos further escalate my dream to work on board the ISS, performing those regular activities and the different experiments, thereby observing the effects of microgravity in-person.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also have a keen interest in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.
				I like to watch videos and read articles on robot dogs like Spot, human-like robot like Sophia, the applications of AI and robotics in unique and different ways (for example, in home delivery) and soft robotics which is I believe is an emerging and immensely interesting branch of robotics. 
			</p>
			<h2>Aspirations</h2>
			<p>As a future engineer, I am aiming to revolutionize the world of technology by:
				<ul>
				<li>Using technology for the benefit and betterment of humankind.</li>
				<li>Contributing in this search for a planet B and finding one</li>
				<li>Designing and implementing sustainable ideas for solving the problems faced by millions of people all around the world</li>
				<li>Helping the UN achieve its <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">goals</a></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The basic equation of my life is,
			<br>
			<br>
			<em>Now + excitement = happiness</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			Being enthusiastic about my work and acknowledging the smallest of achievements on my way to achieving something big is something which has always helped me to work with dedication, perseverance and focus. 
			Planning the future but living and putting the best efforts in the present with 100% excitement enables me to produce the best quality work.
